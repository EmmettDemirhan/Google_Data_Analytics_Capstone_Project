 Case Study(Bellabeat): How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

This repository contains the analysis of smart device usage data, focusing on providing strategic marketing insights for Bellabeat, a health-focused tech company for women. This project is part of the capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) program.

## Project Overview

Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, seeks to understand the broader trends in smart device usage to effectively tailor marketing strategies. This analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in smart device usage from non-Bellabeat products like Fitbit, providing insights that can inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategies and product development.

### Objectives

- Analyze physical activity, sleep monitoring, and heart rate data from Fitbit users.
- Provide actionable insights for Bellabeat's marketing strategies.
- Identify opportunities for product development and customer engagement.

## Data Source

The analysis utilizes the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) from Kaggle, available under the CC0: Public Domain license. This dataset comprises personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users and includes minute-level output for various metrics.
