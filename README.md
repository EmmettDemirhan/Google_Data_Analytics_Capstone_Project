# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
 Case Study (Bellabeat): How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

This repository contains the analysis of smart device usage data, focusing on providing strategic marketing insights for Bellabeat, a health-focused tech company for women. This project is part of the capstone project for the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) program.

## Project Overview

Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, seeks to understand the broader trends in smart device usage to effectively tailor marketing strategies. This analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in smart device usage from non-Bellabeat products like Fitbit, providing insights that can inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategies and product development.

### Objectives

- Analyze physical activity, sleep monitoring, and heart rate data from Fitbit users.
- Provide actionable insights for Bellabeat's marketing strategies.
- Identify opportunities for product development and customer engagement.

## Data Source

The analysis utilizes the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) from Kaggle, available under the CC0: Public Domain license. This dataset comprises personal fitness tracker data from thirty two Fitbit users and includes minute-level output for various metrics.

## Key Findings

- **Peak Activity Hours**: Elevated physical activity observed between 5 PM and 7 PM on Weekdays and around noon on Saturdays, suggesting post-work exercise routines and weekend leisure activities.
- **Day-wise Activity Variations**: Higher median steps on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with weekends showing sporadic high activity bursts.
- **Physical Activity**: Significant variability in user's physical activity levels.
- **Sleep Patterns**: Varying sleep patterns with less sleep noted on specific weekdays.
- **Sedentary Trends**: Predominance of sedentary behavior in daily routines.
- **Caloric Expenditure**: Positive correlation between physical activity and calories burned.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhance Sleep Monitoring Features**: Develop personalized sleep insights, especially for days with observed reduced sleep patterns.
2. **Introduce Movement Alerts**: Implement features to encourage movement, particularly during periods of high sedentary behavior.
3. **Optimize Engagement for Peak Activity Hours**: Tailor engagement strategies and motivational content to align with peak activity periods, like weekday evenings and Saturday noons.
4. **Targeted Wellness Interventions**: Develop wellness interventions for consistent physical activity across the week, focusing on days with lower median steps and leveraging high activity bursts.
5. **Expand Data Collection**: Include demographic information to deepen insights and tailor strategies to diverse user groups.

## Limitations

The analysis is constrained by the size and scope of the dataset, which is somewhat dated and lacks demographic information.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides Bellabeat with foundational insights to enhance user engagement and refine product features. Continuous data collection and adaptation to user preferences are essential for maintaining market relevance.
